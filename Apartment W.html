<p>You finally make it back home.
</p>
<p>You: Ahhhhh~ so nice to be home.
</p>
<p>You throw your backpack against the wall and lay yourself on the bed in relaxation staring at the wall.

<p>After thinking a bit on your dinner, you finally stand up and glance at your backpack.
</p>
<p>You: I wonder how's Kisara's doing...
