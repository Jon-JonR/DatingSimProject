<p>On the way home you walk by the familar walkway you always take on the way home from school.
</p>
<p>Your thoughts: I really wonder if I end up making another friend...
</p>
<p>You suddenly get a flashback to when you lost a close friend due to arguments.

You could vividly remember how hurt you felt when you were told to leave her alone.
</p>
<p>You merely rub off the idea and hope for the best.
</p>
<p>Nah.. It won't happened again...
